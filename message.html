        Everthing has a reason. 
        
        You're still here for a reason.
        You probably woke up today and asked yourself, "Why am I still alive?" 
        You are still here, because your time is not yet up.
        Your life will be a blessing to others. 

        Though you're facing silent battles,
        you are so brave for showing up. 
        The way you push through the day is an inspiration to someone.
        The way you smile and laugh even though you're falling apart inside makes someone smile and happy, too.
        Because you are still here. To them, you are still present. 
        Even though you're barely making it. Others see your strength and bravery. 
        Others can still see you trying each day. 
        
        Though you fail and lose some battles,
        don't be afraid to try again.
        Don't be afraid to start over again, because wherever you are in your journey, 
        you are never behind nor is it too late for you to start again. 

        You are so brave. 
        Your parents are so proud of you to see you still trying.
        Your friends are happy to have you in their lives. 
        You matter. So keep on pushing through! We are so proud of you.
        Always remember that you are deeply loved.

                                                                      With Love
                                                                        Always&#128151;
